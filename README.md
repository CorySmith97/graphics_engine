# Simple Graphics Engine

The idea of this project is to experiment with the Sokol API to get some simple cross-platform graphics showing. The language of choice is Rust.

As of now it is a very basic OpenGL example of a cube with basic movement and camera manipulation all built on the Sokol App and Sokol GFX API.
